iOS
In order to run L√ñVE for iOS, it must first be compiled and installed. To do that, you‚Äôll need Mac OS X, Xcode 7 or newer, and the L√ñVE for iOS source code downloadable from the home page.

If the include and libraries folders are not present in the love/platform/xcode/ios folder, download them and place them there. They contain the third-party library dependencies used by L√ñVE.
Open the Xcode project found at love/platform/xcode/love.xcodeproj and select the love-ios target in the dropdown menu at the top of the window.
You may want to change the Build Configuration from Debug to Release for better performance, by opening the "Edit Scheme..." menu from the same dropdown selection.
Choose either an iOS Simulator device or your plugged-in iOS device in the dropdown selection to the right of the previous one, and click the Build-and-Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏é button to the left, which will install L√ñVE on the target device after compiling it.
L√ñVE on iOS includes a simple list interface of games that are installed (until you fuse a .love to it for distribution.)

To put a .love file on the iOS Simulator after L√ñVE is installed, drag the file onto the iOS Simulator‚Äôs window while it‚Äôs open. L√ñVE will launch if it‚Äôs not running already. If another game is currently active you may need to quit L√ñVE for the new game to show up (press Shift-Command-H twice to open the App Switcher menu on the iOS Simulator.)
To put a .love file or game folder on your iOS device after L√ñVE is installed, you can either download it with the Safari, or transfer it from your computer through iTunes when your device is connected: open iTunes, go to the iOS device which has L√ñVE installed, go to the ‚ÄòApps‚Äô section and scroll down and find L√ñVE, and add the .love file or game folder to L√ñVE‚Äôs Documents section. On more recent iOS and Mac versions, you can use Airdrop to transfer your .love file from your Mac to where L√ñVE is installed.
See the Game Distribution page for creating Fused L√ñVE games on iOS and distributing them.
